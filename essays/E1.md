So currently, I have made an attempt once at every single WOD so far. I passed two and have failed one. The WOD's 1-3 took me 24 min., 7 min., and 16 min. I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, VSCODE, and VSCODE's extensions. What has helped me the most in completing the WOD's is to have a game plan when you start the WOD and also to not worrry about failing. The WOD is meant to challenge and you are not expected to finish everything in Rx time the first time around. When working on Web applications, Live server was a huge help because I was able to see my work in real time without having to manually reload any pages. I plan to read all your guys's essays as well and hope to learn much. Thanks for reading.
