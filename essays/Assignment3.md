Describe your system
My E-Commerce Page sells a variety of what I would consider classic fantasy novels.

Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
I think I have 2 major shortcomings on this assignment.
1. My missing IR. I was not able to complete it because I could not finish the required steps until the end to implement it.
2. I lack the use of a session/cookie to prevent people from going to the invoice page with logging in first. 

Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
I am most proud of the amount of work that I put into it and the small wins that I had when completing what I had finished. The assignment was very difficult, but figuring out how to set a cookie or create and callback a function within the use of the cookie was cool. It was like connecting several different portions of what I learned into one. 

Describe what you are least happy with your system:
I am least happy with not being able to finish the assignment. I wish it was also a little more user friendly and had better pages for the shopping cart and invoice, so that I could show pictures along with the prices.

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
The use of cookies and sessions for one. But unlike assignment 1 and 2, I found myself delting code and restructuring with new ideas. 

When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
I went straight to youtube and the assignment 3 example code. I tried to kind of figure out what it was saying and then try to use it for my own. Almost like an archaeologist translating lost texts hahaha.

Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
Everything went okay to pretty well. The best part of the assignment like I said before was just learning small things and knowing where to put what I had just learned into my code.

Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
The timing of the assignment did not work out well. I ended assignment 2 late and had less time to work with assignment 3, leading to my unfinished and unturned in project.

What did you learn from doing this assignment?
Time management is obviously important, but it is extremely important when trying to learn and implement code at the same time. You have to plan accordingly, and then add a whole lot of buffer just in case.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
I would change my time used to study ITM. It is a hell of a lot to learn inside and outside of class. I learn best when taught, so having to learn outside of class made it difficult for me.

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I spent about 75% of my time thinking and coming up with EXACTLY what I wanted/needed to do and used the other 25% of the time writing it. The key to coding is not the big picture, but the immaculately small details. Focusing on one and only one thing at a time is the smartest way to approach problems in ITM352.
