## Raise your hand if your degree you chose was not your first choice.

Like most everyone else reading this, MIS was not my first major. Starting with Biology, I went to school and got okay grades for a single year. Feeling guilty about the money being spent on me, I took time off to reevaluate. I went back to school a year later with reinvented passion. But once again, I found that what I was doing I did not enjoy. 

I am still trying to find that passion. My dream of working in a hospital lost its shine after working in a radiology department as a student tech. I was good at it, but the crowd was what threw me off. Everyone was so introverted. So, suprise, I took a major whose demographic you would expect to be even more introverted hahaha. But her I am, jumping head first into the world MIS.
