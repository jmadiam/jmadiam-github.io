Most recently, I completed workout of the day (WOD) [Invoice 1](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html) . This WOD was focused on creating a simple code to total items from an e-commerce store. I know I said simple, but it took me 3 tries and over 2 hours of watching how to complete it. For me, watching the video helped a lot because I needed something visual to not copy, but understand what was happening. After watching the WOD completed, I could map out the steps to completing the exercise. Sometimes the WODs can be intimidating, but I think that if you can draw out or write all the steps, you are able to see the big picture, and then all the little steps kind of fall into place. Just like how certain paintings need some viewers to distance themselves in order to see what is painted, get some distance..... take a breathe.... and try not focusing on all the small details. I think for the next WOD, I will read all of the instructions first and then create my plan of attack. ALSO, never skip the readings and screencasts!!! I could have been much better prepared if I had just done those simple steps. Thanks for reading:)
