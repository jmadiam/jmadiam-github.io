I will be answering in a Q&A response, as I feel that it is the easiest way (for you) to read. Also, I learned that copying and pasting is always a great way to not miss anything... this way, I will not miss any important questions that need to be answered.
Q: My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
A: My programming skills have stagnated. I have missed labs and/or been unable to complete them, which have led me to my stagnation of skill and understanding in class. Unfortunately, assignment 1 is still unfinished and I am in a scramble to catch up.

Q: I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
A: I need to spend more time watching the lectures or finding new resources to help me better understand what I cannot grasp in class. 
RTFM means read the fucking manual, and I PROMISE this is an acronym you will never forget.
Q?: I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I have learned much from the WOD’s that I have completed. What everyone hates is that you WILL have to do them repeatedly to get them right. But by the time you get them right, you will have figured out a pretty efficient way of completing the assignment, have a more robust understanding of the question, and know how to properly solve it.
Q: The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs have helped me learn and have been very important in the practice of what we are learning in class and reading outside of class.

Q: I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
A: I have yet to complete assignment 1 but have still learned much in terms of patience and RTFM’ing. I think I have just found a good resource on Youtube on how to build my server. You will be updated by my next post on how everything is going:)
 Q:I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
A:  I think that having a prerequisite before ITM352 would be a great way to lower the learning curve and dropout rate within the first week of class.
Doing more examples in class and having the class more engaged I believe will help everyone understand more. Plus, engagement would help improve atmosphere of this serious class and probably bring more people together to collaborate.
More access to help.
Q: What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
A: What helps me the best is showing up to class, one on one help, and readings. Being present, showing up when you need help, and reading are very important. When I am unable to understand certain ideas, I go to the internet for help. 9/10 times there is something for me. 90% is a good percentage, but do not be afraid to go in for help early in the semester or often. This class will only snowball your misunderstanding the further you get. If I can impress anything upon (you)* if you have not taken the class yet, it is do not doubt the hours you will need to spend on this class, and do not linger hoping for understanding to come to you. If you do not understand, ask for help and help yourself as well. You will do great.
